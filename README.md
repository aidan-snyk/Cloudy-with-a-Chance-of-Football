## Description

Fantasy football allows fans to act as team managers by drafting, trading for, acquiring, and playing real football players in on fantasy football platforms, scoring points using a scoring system based on real life performance of their players. Fantasy football platforms (such as [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/) or [Yahoo!](https://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/)) apply their own analytics to project player performance weekly during the NFL season in preparation for the upcoming week. It is not uncommon for players to score well above or far below their platform-projected fantasy score, leaving fantasy managers wondering which players to draft, trade for, acquire, and play.

We want to know what influences a player's *actual* fantasy score so that we can make data-driven decisions when building a team or weekly starting lineup during the NFL season. To do so, we're using 2019 and 2020 NFL season data and ESPN fantasy football projection data for this project.

## Machine Learning

We intend to use a classification model with a 80/20 train/test split to determine whether or not a player will perform above or below the projected fantasy points. Critical to this model is engineering binary features to complement the numeric features we have found, and fine-tuning parameters to make the model account for complexities in the selected features, but flexible enough to take in 2021 fantasy projections and help fantasy managers to decide who to draft, start, trade for, and pick up off of the waiver wire.

Our intent is to deploy our trained model to a web application that requests basic user input and takes certain features into account to provide a prediction (which could be taken as a recommendation) about a playerâ€™s performance in the coming week.
